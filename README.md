# 🔥 Malbolge | The Most Rare and Hellishly Difficult Programming Language 🔥

> **Malbolge** named after the eighth circle of Hell from Dante’s Inferno  is *the* esoteric programming language designed to *torment* even the bravest programmers. Invented in 1998 by Ben Olmstead, it’s infamous for being nearly impossible to write and understand, thanks to its weird base-3 arithmetic, self-altering code, and the infamous “crazy operation.”

‎ 
## 💀 Why Malbolge?

* **Designed to be almost impossible to use**
* Uses self-modifying code to make debugging a nightmare
* Rarely used outside of programming challenges and esoteric art projects
* A true test of a programmer’s patience and brainpower
* Named after a hellish place fitting, right?
