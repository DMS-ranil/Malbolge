# 🔥 Malbolge | The Most Rare and Hellishly Difficult Programming Language 🔥

> **Malbolge** named after the eighth circle of Hell from Dante’s Inferno  is *the* esoteric programming language designed to *torment* even the bravest programmers. Invented in 1998 by Ben Olmstead, it’s infamous for being nearly impossible to write and understand, thanks to its weird base-3 arithmetic, self-altering code, and the infamous “crazy operation.”


## 💀 Why Malbolge?

* **Designed to be almost impossible to use**
* Uses self-modifying code to make debugging a nightmare
* Rarely used outside of programming challenges and esoteric art projects
* A true test of a programmer’s patience and brainpower
* Named after a hellish place fitting, right?


## 🚀 Hello World In Malbolge 

Here is the classic "Hello World" program in Malbolge:

```malbolge
(=<`#9]76Z{z2V0/S-Qr*)M:,+*)('&$#"!~}|{z(Kw%$t"Vq0iAm,,j<h'`%
```

Run this and behold the magic of Malbolge!


## 🎯 Challenge: Can You Modify This?

Try changing the output to your name or a short phrase. Be warned: Malbolge code is notoriously difficult to read or write by hand!
