# Malbolge
WRITING HELLO WORLD IN THE MOST RARE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

---

> Malbolge is a public-domain esoteric programming language invented by Ben Olmstead in 1998, named after the eighth circle of hell in Dante's Inferno, the Malebolge. It was specifically designed to be almost impossible to use, via a counter-intuitive "crazy operation", base three arithmetic, and self altering code.
